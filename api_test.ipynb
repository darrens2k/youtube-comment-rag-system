      "I&#39;ve been using a Pixel 9 Pro Fold since they first came out, and my views differ from yours. First off, the reasons you specify for going Pixel are WAY different than mine. The main reason I, and many other tech savvy people go Pixel is for Stock Android. We want the updates and new capabilities the fastest Google can create them. Second is build quality and battery duration, both of which the Pixels (I started with the Pixel 5) deliver on. And as to the folding screen, I present two use cases that you did not comment on, and yet they are critical when recommending this phone. First, in addition to the Pro Fold, I also purchased a folding Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and a case that has a kickstand. This allows me to use the Fold as I might a laptop or tablet, and has actually made it so I don&#39;t have to have a laptop anymore for work. It&#39;s amazing. And second, the people who are most interested in my fold when I am using it, are senior citizens. The screen is WAY bigger, and makes it easier to use with those that don&#39;t have great eyes. I could also add that if you view lots of video on your phone, the bigger screen is WAY better. Same with games.\n",

      "I don&#39;t know what changed - your lens or lighting or something but it has so much pop and I love it! Don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible for this but if you need to hear this: you did great, I appreciate you!\n",
      "its like a filter was removed. And I agree it pops more. \n",
      "\n",
      "I&#39;ll get mine hopefully tomorrow! For me, the Pixel software experience, IP68 (a &#39;must have&#39; if I use a foldable as a daily driver), Pixelsnap, and a big battery are enough reasons to look forward to it!\n",
      "Best wishes man \n",

      "Why are these foldables still expensive after 7 years of launch ?!.. their price should be around 1200-1300$ by now.<br>Or at least a version with not flagship chips..like for regular phones their is 1000$ phone as well as 500$ phone.\n",
      "They&#39;re a little bit cheaper when you factor in inflation, the fact they cost the same when non foldables are going <b>up</b> is probably the best we can hope for these days \n",
